ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION -- TO BE CODED 
Kruskal's Algorithms for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

1)Create set E which includes all edges
2)Soft set E in ascending order of weight
3)Iterate through set E and check if adding the element creates a cycle
4)If yes: Discard element
5)If no: Add to spanning tree via Union() and move on to next element
5i)Union() is used to add an edge/element into the minimum spanning tree.
6)End algorithm once all vertices are reached (E = (Vertices - 1)) as MST is found
7)Return MST & Elements
